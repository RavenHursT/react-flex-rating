A (semi)full-featured React rating component.

- Built w/ functional components
- Dynamic rating-icon count, value, maximum
- Allows for half-icon ratings
- Intuitive over-states (i.e. _both_ currently active icons and non-active icons will react to hover)
- Built w/ [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/) for easy, flexible, overriding of styles
- Plays nice w/ [material-ui 1.4.x](https://material-ui.com/)
